# OOPS

- Encapsulation -> Class (eg)
       Binding of data & functiion

- Instance -> whatever you create using a class -> user defined data type
- Object -> Stores data

            Has properties (attributes)

            Has actions (methods)
- Variable -> Class Vriable
              Instance Variable
              Local Variable

- Constructors -> 

A constructor is a special function inside a class that:

Runs automatically when an object is created

Initializes (assigns) values to object variables

1. Default Constructor
2. Poppy Constructor

- Polymorphism ->Same function name behaves differently for different objects.
Types:
1. Compile-Time Polymorphism
(Also called Method Overloading)
2. Run-Time Polymorphism
(Also called Method Overriding)
3. Operator overriding

- Access Specifiers

1️⃣ Public -> Can be accessed anywhere (inside class, outside class, anywhere).
2️⃣ Protected -> Should be accessed inside class and derived (child) class
3️⃣ Private-> Can be accessed only inside the class
4️⃣ Default -> If no modifier is written → it becomes default 

- Attribute
